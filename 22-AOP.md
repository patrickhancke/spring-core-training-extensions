# AOP

Think of use cases in your current project where you could benefit from AOP techniques. Did you actually use it? Why (not)?

How would you write a test for your AOP-enabled business logic? Can you do this with a simple unit test? Or do you need an integration test where (part of) the Spring Application context is initialized?

Imagine the class _MyAspect_ implements your aspect. Does this class allow you to autowire Spring beans?
