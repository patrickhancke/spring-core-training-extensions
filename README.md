# Spring Core training: extensions

The material presented in this Github repository is meant as an extension to the [Spring Core training](https://tanzu.vmware.com/training/courses/core-spring-training), provided by Pivotal/VMWare.

Please note that this is not part of the official course.

Its main purpose is to challenge students who already finished the labs by making them think about more advanced topics and issues. As is often the case in the real world, there's not always a simple right/wrong answer.

Have fun and let me know your feedback.
